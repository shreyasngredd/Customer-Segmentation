## Customer Segmentation using Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis

In this project, we distinguished and found similarities between different customer groups using Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis for a hypothetical company 
based on a credit card dataset.

### How will this project help the hypothetical company? 
Major corporations and large size retail outlets often have difficulty keeping a track about the buying habits of each and every customer, but it is important that businesses 
keep a consistent base of customers and simultaneously try to expand the customer base, but most major corporations and large size retail outlets often have difficulty keeping 
a track about the buying habits of each and every customer. In order to achieve that, we studied the ‘best’ customers i.e., the regular, high-spending customers as well 
as the high-risk of churning or ‘dormant’ customers. This prevents the company from spending its limited resources on customers that are likely to churn and prevents the 
valuable customers from churning by offering them personalized marketing campaigns.  

We used the customer credit card behaviour to understand their transactional patterns and hence, target them with campaigns accordingly. 
We used K-means clustering algorithm to identify the customer segments from the variables given in the dataset and Linear Discriminant Analysis in order to make a comparison 
of results from K-means clustering and see if the variables chosen to help in distinguishing different customer segments. 

With these results, we made marketing recommendations on the basis of the customer segments achieved. In detail we will discuss, what kind of customers we are encountering 
and how the retail company can market to them.
